# Homeless-Simulator 
Day in a life of a homeless person, choose your own adventure game 

Homelessness involves a cycle of poverty and desperation perpetuating negative stereotypes, especially for underserved communities like queer people of color. Our project for 2023 QWER Hacks was to create a game to demonstrate the struggles of being an unhoused individual in LA. We present Homeless Simulator, the game that fosters empathy and donates $1 to a charity combating homelessness with every playthrough. This game was developed using React.

Each choice will correspond to a different ending and possibilites.
